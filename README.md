# Image Classification on CIFAR-10

This repository contains a Jupyter notebook that demonstrates the process of building a convolutional neural network (CNN) to classify images from the CIFAR-10 dataset. CIFAR-10 is a dataset that consists of 60,000 32x32 color images in 10 different classes.

## Features

- Data visualization of CIFAR-10 images.
- Preprocessing of image data.
- Construction of a CNN model using TensorFlow and Keras.
- Implementation of custom callbacks for training control.

## Notebook

The main notebook, `Image-classification-cifar10.ipynb`, is hosted on Google Colab and can be found at the following link:
